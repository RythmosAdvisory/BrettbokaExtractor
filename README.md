Extracting password protected PDFs as a reverse engineering exercise

## Why?
At our school we use digital books, which means we can only read the books through any application that is provided to us.

I decided to take this as a learning opportunity to practice some reverse engineering.

I also do not endorse any illegal use of this software etc. etc. This is strictly for learning etc. etc.

## Dependencies

The project is dependent on the PdfSharp and iTextSharp library
